<p>“Lightning Talks” are short presentation meant to introduce a topic to audiences of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>These talks will be entirely student-run, which means that anyone is welcome to sign up to give a talk on any topic they’d like (provided that it’s related to mathematics!), and anyone is welcome to attend!</p>
<p>If you’d like to give a talk, sign up at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WT2ij8aJgI170WBVfwBI0R87IfXmCovCEORtgEXBC7U/edit#gid=0" class="uri">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WT2ij8aJgI170WBVfwBI0R87IfXmCovCEORtgEXBC7U/edit#gid=0</a></p>
<p>As usual, there will also be raffle for a free Math book!</p>
<h2 id="agenda">Agenda</h2>
<ul>
<li>Talks (5:05 - 6:05)
<ul>
<li><p>Talk 1 The Mathematical Theory of Brownian Motion (Kim Udomprapasup)</p>
<p>This talk will discuss the mathematical theory of Brownian Motion, beginning with its description and some of its interesting properties. We will also explore its connections to other areas of mathematics, including Harmonic Analysis and PDEs.</p>
<p>If time permits, we will also briefly discuss Stochastic Calculus.</p>
<p>Background Required: Calculus and basic probability theory - expectation, mean, variance, distributions, etc. Some knowledge of Real Analysis and Differential Equations will also be helpful to appreciate the later topics.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Raffle (6:00 - 6:05) This month’s book will be related to Brownian motion!</li>
</ul>
