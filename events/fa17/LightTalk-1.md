A lightning talk is a short presentation meant to quickly 
introduce a topic or concept to an audience.

These talks are held monthly and are entirely student-run. 
Attendance is open to any and all students, with any level 
of mathematical background.

We also hold raffles for math-related books and provide 
light refreshments.
