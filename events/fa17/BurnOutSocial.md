Burnout Social is an event held near the end of the quarter, after the second round 
of midterms and before finals week. It’s meant to give “burned out” mathematics 
students a break from studying for exams to relax and enjoy the company of fellow 
students. We also offer students the opportunity to use the room to form study 
groups or to get help from other students present who have taken similar classes. 
Snacks and supplies for finals will be available, such as pens, pencils, and blue 
books.
