In this workshop, we will be introducing the paradigm of "functional" programming,  
programming style that is built upon the idea of composing mathematical functions.  
In essence, functional languages provide ways to write small, modular pieces of code  
that can be composed together to solve complex problems.

In addition to its close ties to theoretical math, it is also an incredibly useful skill  
that makes certain difficult problems much easier to solve! It obviates the need for things  
like tracking array indices, and is commonly used in tasks such as data cleaning and analysis.

This workshop will be a code-along demonstration, covering some of the main ideas at the core  
of many functional languages. No background necessary, as we will cover the concepts from the  
ground up, but some familiarity with at least one programming language helpful!
