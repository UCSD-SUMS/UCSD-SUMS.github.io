In this workshop, we will be introducing the paradigm of "functional" programming: 
a programming style that is built upon the idea of composing mathematical functions 
(note, not necessarily the same as programmatic). In essence, functional languages 
provide ways to write small, modular pieces of code that can be composed together 
to solve complex problems.

In addition to its close ties to theoretical math, it is also an incredibly useful 
skill that makes certain difficult problems much easier to solve! For instance, it 
obviates the need to track array indices, and it is commonly used in tasks such 
as data cleaning and analysis.

This workshop will be a code-along demonstration, covering some of the main ideas 
at the core of many functional languages. No background is necessary, as we will 
cover the concepts from the ground up. But, some familiarity with at least one 
programming language helpful!
