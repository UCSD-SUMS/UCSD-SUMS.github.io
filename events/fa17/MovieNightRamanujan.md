Come join us for a mathematical movie! Continuing this year's theme  
of "Infamous 20th Century Mathematicians", we will be screening "The  
Man Who Knew Infinity". This movie is an account of the life of  
Srinivasa Ramanujan, a prolific Indian mathematician of the early  
1900s who is known for his contributions to number theory and  
mathematical analysis, particularly with respect to his work on  
infinite series and continued fractions. He produced numerous results  
in these areas, but his life was tragically cut short at the age of 32.

Admission is free to all UCSD students! Pizza, snacks, popcorn and  
refreshments will be served.
