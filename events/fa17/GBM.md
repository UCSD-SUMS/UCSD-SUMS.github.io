The first major GBM of the year. Meet fellow undergraduate mathematicians,  
both incoming and returning, and learn what SUMS is all about! Fun events  
planned for the year will be discussed, as well as how __you__ (yes you!)  
can become a member and/or get involved in an official capacity. Food and    
refreshments will be provided (current expectation is pizza, always the  
best)!
