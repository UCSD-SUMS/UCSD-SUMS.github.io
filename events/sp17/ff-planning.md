# Agenda

## Introductions
* Rearrange the room so people can face each other:
* Go around room, have each person share:
    * Name
    * Year
    * Major
    * Mathematical Background
    * Favorite area/subject of math

## What are Freeform Friday's?

What is the purpose of these events?

We want to aim for an interactive format, that lies somewhere between a workshop and a purely social event.

We want to pick activities/topics/themes that are related to math, and at the same time makes it easy for people to talk and participate. 

Basically, both freshmen and more experienced students (even including grad students) should be able to contribute with something to conversation.

# Topic:
$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty i = -\frac{1}{12}$$

Maybe do an intro on analytic continuation and/or Ramanujan summation.

## Potential Questions
General questions:
* What is the role/potential of popular math?
* How is it done well (and how should it not be done)?

About particular videos:
* How did the video approach the topic?
* Who is it aimed at? What are they trying to accomplish?
* What did (or didn't) we understand? 
    * Can anyone explain the difficult bits for others? 
* Did we like this approach or not? 
* What did we like (or not like) about it?
* How did the video portray mathematics as a field?
* How does it work for certain audiences inside/outside the math community? 
* Where is this on a scale from 1-10?
