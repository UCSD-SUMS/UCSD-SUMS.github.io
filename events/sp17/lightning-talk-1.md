"Lightning Talks" are short presentation meant to introduce a topic to
audiences of all backgronuds.

These talks will be entirely student-run, which means that anyone is
welcome to sign up to give a talk on any topic they'd like (provided
that it's related to mathematics!), and anyone is welcome to attend!

If you'd like to give a talk, sign up at
