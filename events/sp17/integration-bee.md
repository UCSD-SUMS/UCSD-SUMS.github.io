On June 2nd, SUMS is hosting its annual Integration Bee! Sign up to compete at [http://tinyurl.com/2017integrationbee](http://tinyurl.com/2017integrationbee).

(Don't know what an integration bee is? Check here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_Bee)

An event originating from Math graduate students at MIT, students will compete to complete integrals as fast and as accurate as possible, for prizes and glory. These integrals aren't the boring, mechanical ones you see in class though- we promise, they're devious and tricky, and WILL sweep you off your feet if you're unprepared! ;)

Refreshments and dinner will be offered at the event, so come along!

Whether you're competing, supporting a friend or just spectating the spectacle, put your integrating hats on, and prepare to integrate like never before!!
