A quarterly event in which we screen a film about mathematics! 

This year's theme is: "(In)Famous 20th Century Mathematicians"
![Possible Movies](https://github.com/UCSD-SUMS/UCSD-SUMS.github.io/raw/hakyll/movies.jpg)

## Screening: "A Beautiful Mind"

A biographical drama about the mathematician John Nash, who notably won the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics for his pioneering contributions to Game Theory and the 2015 Abel Prize for his work in nonlinear partial differential equations.

The film depicts his life at Princeton, including the development of the idea that is now referred to as a "Nash Equilibrium", as well as his struggles with paranoid schizophrenia through the height of the Cold War.

There will also be a short talk before the movie introducing some of the mathematical ideas Nash is known for.
