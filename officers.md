                            Zack joined SUMS to help build a math community at UCSD. He hopes SUMS continues to be a meeting 
                            place and community of learning where people share their 
                            love and knowledge of math. His favorite math fact is that the sum of all n of the nth roots of 
                            unity is exactly zero. He feels that this fact gives rise to so many cool connections between 
                            algebra and geometry, and contains many nice symmetries--and one can recover Euler's infamous identity 
                            as a special case! Zack has approximate knowledge of many musical instruments--drums, guitar, and a bit 
                            of piano. He also cycles often and enjoys restoring/rebuilding old arcade machines.

                            Upon transferring to UCSD, Aiden saw a lack of a mathematics community. He joined SUMS after seeing a chance 
                            to build and join such a community. His favorite field of mathematics is probability, as it forces us to abandon 
                            our intuitions and to instead focus on mathematical reasoning. Aiden enjoys snowboarding, listening to music, and 
                            playing video games.

                            Simon decided to get involved with SUMS because he felt UCSD did not have an organization that could provide the 
                            undergraduate math community with the resources necessary to succeed. He has a deep passion for math and wants to share 
                            that passion with other math majors at UCSD. His favorite field of math is partial differential equations (PDEs), as they 
                            help model a lot of physical phenomena, which he thinks is amazing. In particular, PDEs have so many applications for physics 
                            in engineering (his major). Simon enjoys reading, watching Netflix, and working on personal projects.

                            Peter joined SUMS since he enjoys abstract math and computer science related math, and had been attending Zack's lightning talks 
                            regularly. As he became more involved with SUMS' lightning talks, he decided to attend meetings and become an officer. He hopes to 
                            gain lots of fun math learning/teaching experience out of SUMS and hopes to meet other math loving undergrads. His favorite field of 
                            math is category theory, as it seems to unify all the other fields of mathematics. He finds univalent foundations and homotopy type 
                            theory cool as well. In addition, his favorite mathematician is either David Hilbert, for introducing formalism into mathematics, or 
                            Alonzo Church, for introducing math into computer science. Peter's interests include research relating to programing languages, 
                            reading, and occasional bicycling.

                            Being a Math–CS Major at UCSD, Keenan was dismayed at the lack of a strong community of math students. Being a part of SUMS has 
                            allowed him to change this, and and has allowed him to encourage a community more welcoming to math students. From what little 
                            college math he has covered so far, he has found himself enjoying abstract algebra a lot. He cannot wait to take the MATH 100 
                            sequence (Abstract Algebra) at UCSD. Keenan enjoys hiking, biking, and traveling around in general. In fact, he has been learning 
                            to drive recently, as it is his dream to go on a road trip in the U.S.
