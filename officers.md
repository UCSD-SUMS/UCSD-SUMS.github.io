                            Zack joined SUMS to help build a math community at UCSD. He hopes SUMS continues to be a meeting 
                            place and community of learning where people share their 
                            love and knowledge of math. His favorite math fact is that the sum of all n of the nth roots of 
                            unity is exactly zero. He feels that this fact gives rise to so many cool connections between 
                            algebra and geometry, and contains many nice symmetries--and one can recover Euler's infamous identity 
                            as a special case! Zack has approximate knowledge of many musical instruments--drums, guitar, and a bit 
                            of piano. He also cycles often and enjoys restoring/rebuilding old arcade machines.

                            Upon transferring to UCSD, Aiden saw a lack of a mathematics community. He joined SUMS after seeing a chance 
                            to build and join such a community. His favorite field of mathematics is probability, as it forces us to
                            abandon our intuitions and to instead focus on mathematical reasoning. Aiden enjoys snowboarding, listening
                            to music, and playing video games.

                            Simon decided to get involved with SUMS because he felt UCSD did not have an organization that could provide
                            the undergraduate math community with the resources necessary to succeed. He has a deep passion for math and
                            wants to share that passion with other math majors at UCSD. His favorite field of math is partial
                            differential equations (PDEs), as they help model a lot of physical phenomena, which he thinks is amazing.
                            In particular, PDEs have so many applications for physics and in engineering (his major). Simon enjoys
                            reading, watching Netflix, and working on personal projects.

                            Peter joined SUMS since he enjoys abstract math and computer science related math, and had been attending
                            Zack's lightning talks regularly. As he became more involved with SUMS' lightning talks, he decided to
                            attend meetings and become an officer. He hopes to gain lots of fun math learning/teaching experience out of
                            SUMS and hopes to meet other math loving undergrads. His favorite field of 
                            math is category theory, as it seems to unify all the other fields of mathematics. He finds univalent
                            foundations and homotopy type theory cool as well. In addition, his favorite mathematician is either David
                            Hilbert, for introducing formalism into mathematics, or Alonzo Church, for introducing math into computer
                            science. Peter's interests include research relating to programing languages, reading, and occasional
                            bicycling.

                            Being a Mathâ€“CS Major at UCSD, Keenan was dismayed at the lack of a strong community of math students. Being
                            a part of SUMS has allowed him to change this, and and has allowed him to encourage a community more
                            welcoming to math students. From what little college math he has covered so far, he has found himself
                            enjoying abstract algebra a lot. He cannot wait to take the MATH 100 sequence (Abstract Algebra) at UCSD.
                            Keenan enjoys hiking, biking, and traveling around in general. In fact, he has been learning to drive
                            recently, as it is his dream to go on a road trip in the U.S.
