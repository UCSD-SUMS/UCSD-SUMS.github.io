<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>All undergraduates contemplating future graduate study in pure or
applied mathematics should enroll in the Math and Applied Mathematics
majors. Some courses are only offered in the fall quarter. Similarly,
others are offered only in the winter quarter. Please plan ahead.
Consider doing a senior thesis in order to graduate with honors. This
will increase your chances of being accepted at the best graduate
schools.</P>

<P>Successful graduate work in mathematics requires skills in formal
reasoning and in constructing rigorous mathematical proofs. These
skills are more essential for success at the graduate level than is
knowledge of any particular topic.&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Mathematics Department receives fliers from graduate programs
not only in the United States, but also from Canada, Australia, and
the United Kingdom which are interested in mathematics majors. These
fliers are placed in notebooks for your review.</P>

<P>The graduate school notebooks are separated into the following
categories:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Mathematics</LI>
   
   <LI>Applied and Computational Mathematics</LI>
   
   <LI>Statistics and Probability</LI>
   
   <LI>Combination of Pure, Applied, Statistics</LI>
   
   <LI>Economics</LI>
   
   <LI>Other</LI>
</OL>

<P>For those of you who may be interested in applying your
mathematical skills to other graduate programs besides math, some
topic areas include biomathematical sciences, cognitive sciences,
computer science, industrial engineering, mathematical finance,
neuroscience, oceanography, operations research, telecommunications,
visual science, and water resource systems engineering.</P>

<P>Most applications for graduate programs in mathematics must be
submitted between December and February so it is best to contact
Colleges during the summer or access their websites for online
applications and additional information. Please be aware that most
universities will require the following materials with their
applications:</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Three letters of recommendation</LI>
   
   <LI>GRE general and mathematics subject exams</LI>
   
   <LI>Personal statement.</LI>
</OL>

<P>You may also visit the Career Center to pick up a copy of their
Grad School handbook. This handbook includes various sites on the
intemet that contain graduate school information.</P>
