<P><B>Pure Mathematics</B></P>

<P>The Pure Mathematics major is designed for students who are
interested in the theory of mathematics. Pure mathematics majors
often pursue Master's degrees and Ph.D.'s in Mathematics in order to
prepare for a career in research or university level teaching.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Applied Mathematics</B></P>

<P>Applied Mathematicians are interested in the classical
relationships between mathematics, the physical sciences, and
engineering. They often seek employment in industry, utilizing their
skills to solve engineering and computer related problems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Applied Mathematics - Scientific Programming</B></P>

<P>The Mathematics-Scientific Programming major is designed for
individuals who are interested in mathematical theory and the related
applications of computing. These majors often seek employment in
areas similar to the Applied Mathematicians.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Mathematics - Secondary Education</B></P>

<P>Math-Secondary Education is a major designed for students who have
a substantial interest in teaching mathematics at the secondary
level. The senior year includes a paid internship.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Mathematics - Computer Science</B></P>

<P>The Mathematics-Computer Science major trains mathematically
oriented computer scientists who have specialized knowledge in the
mathematical aspects and foundations of computer science or in the
computer applications of mathematics.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Mathematics - Applied Science</B></P>

<P>The Mathematics-Applied Science major is intended for those
students who are interested in mathematics, but who also have a
substantial interest in the applications of mathematics to other
areas. Students majoring in Mathematics/Applied Science often pursue
careers in actuarial science, management consulting, financial
planning, accounting, engineering, medical and life sciences or
operations research.</P>

<P>Students who major in Mathematics-Applied Science may pursue one
of the following plans, for example, or others which can be custom
designed:&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Mathematics-Economics</B></P>

<P>The Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics-Economics is particularly
appropriate preparation for graduate study in business and economics
because the top-ranked graduate programs require strong mathematical
qualifications for admission. It gives an excellent background to
students applying to finance programs in graduate schools of
management. It also provides a solid foundation for entry level
employment in a number of areas of business, finance &amp;
management. Majors are encouraged to undertake an undergraduate
internship.</P>
