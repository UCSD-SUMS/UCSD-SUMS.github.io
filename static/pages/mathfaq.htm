<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Q: How much should I study?</B></P>

<P>A: That depends on the individual. In one study, successful
students put in about 14-15 hours per week to get an A, some more,
some less. Just keep up with the class. Cramming doesn't work.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Q: I don't like my TA (Teaching Assistant). Can I get into
another section?</B></P>

<P>A: No, it is normally impossible to switch sections during the
quarter. Instead, you should find another student to work with. You
can also ask at the Calculus Tutoring Lab if they have study groups
for your class or organize one yourself. The Lab provides free
drop-in tutoring during the day as well. There is also free drop-in
tutoring available in the Office of Academic Support and
Instructional Services (OASIS).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Q: I thought I knew the material, but I did poorly on the
midterm. Should I drop the class?</B></P>

<P>A: Speak to your TA and a Math advisor about your options. If you
decide to stay in class, you need to change your study habits and do
lots of extra problems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Q: My professor goes too fast in lecture and I get lost. What
should I do?</B></P>

<P>A: If you are behind, catch up on your reading. In addition, it's
amazing how much reading before the lecture helps. You don't have to
know it all; skimming the main ideas will enable you to follow the
lecture.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Q: The lectures are useless because the professor doesn't show
me how to do the homework problems.</B></P>

<P>A: The purpose of the lecture is not to show you how to solve
simple problems, but to give you the tools to attack difficult
problems. Typically these involve a combination of techniques from
several sections and require theoretical understanding. On the exams
some of the problems or even all of them may be of this type. It is
inefficient (as well as foolish) to try to memorize solutions to
problems. What matters is the attack.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Q: I'm terrified of my professor and am afraid of seeing him
during office hours; he seems impatient and will not show me how to
do the problems.</B></P>

<P>A: Most math professors are happy to help you if you have
struggled with the problem. However, do not expect them to solve the
problem for you. They want to see that you've spent more than two
minutes on it and looked at the theory in the book so you can ask a
precise question. "I can't do #5" will not advance the
conversation.</P>
