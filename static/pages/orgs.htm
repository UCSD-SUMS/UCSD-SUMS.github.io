<P><B>UCSD Tritons for Mathematics</B></P>

<P>The UCSD Tritons for Mathematics is an alumni organization.
Membership is open to graduates of the UCSD Department of
Mathematics. The mission of this alumni organization is to support
students, research, and programs in mathematics, as well as provide
opportunities for social, professional, and business contacts among
membership. The organization is a great way to keep in touch with
friends, make new ones, and find out what Mathematics alumni are
doing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Mu Alpha Theta (The Math Club)</B></P>

<P>The UCSD Math Club provides opportunities for UCSD students to
find out about internships and career opportunities. The club
organizes social and professional networking events, community
service projects and invites speakers to its colloquia. All
Mathematics majors are encouraged to participate in club activities
early in their undergraduate academic careers.</P>

<P><B>Career Opportunites</B></P>

<P>The Mathematics Department maintains several folders on career
opportunities with a degree in mathematics. Please feel free to stop
by and take a look at our information. In addition, we have a folder
containing information on internship opportunities. We're always
receiving new materials and deadlines vary so we advise reading
through the folders regularly. This is a wonderful resource and a
good starting point for your search. Internship information is also
available through the Academic Internship Program (AIP), which
maintains listing of internships relevant to Mathematics for the
summer and academic year.</P>

<P>The college graduate with a bachelor's degree in mathematics can
qualify for a broad range of highly paid positions in business,
industry, government, and teaching. Companies in the computer and
communications industries employ many mathematicians, as do oil
companies, banks, insurance companies, and consulting firms.</P>

<P>Almost every bureau and branch of the federal government employs
mathematicians in some capacity. Mathematicians, statisticians,
operations researchers, and actuaries work in the Department of
Health and Human Services, the General Accounting Office, the Office
of Management and Budget, and the National Institute of Standards.
The Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Security
Agency also employ many mathematicians.</P>
