NOTATION:  Throughout, H and N are subgroups of G with N normal in G.  The 
	   letters a, b, g denote elements in G.  The permutation group on 
	   4 letters is denoted by S(4).  (The order of S(4) is 4! = 24.)
DIRECTIONS:  Except in #4, your proofs are NOT allowed to refer to "known 
	     results" such as theorems proved in class or in the text.
<HR>
(1)  Consider T={1,2,3,...,820}, which is a group of order 820 under the 
     operation "multiplication mod 821".  It is known that T is cyclic 
     with the generator 2.
     (A)  Find the orders of each of the four elements 8, 16, 32, 64 in T.
	  Explain very briefly.
     (B)  Which one of the four elements in part (A) generates all of T?  
	  Explain very briefly.

<HR>
(2)  Prove the NH = HN.

<HR>
(3)  Prove that S(4) is not abelian.

<HR>
(4)  Let gN be an element of order m in the guotient group G/N.  
     Prove that g^m is in N.  (Your proof here may refer to known results.)

<HR>
(5)  (A)  Let g be in Ha.  Prove in detail that Hg = Ha.
     (B)  Assume that Ha and Hb are not disjoint.  Prove that Ha = Hb.
  	  Hint: Use part (A).
     (C)  Explain briefly why the order of H divides the order of G, when
  	  G is finite.  Hint: Use part (B).
     (D)  Explain briefly why the order of any element g divides the order 
	  of G.  Hint: Use part (C).
