<B>Math 10C Test #4, Summer 1996<B>
<HR>
Show all work and simplify answers.
<HR>
(1)  Which of the following are solutions y to the second order differential 
     equation (x^2)y" = 12y ?  (There may be more than one answer.)
     (A) x+1
     (B) x^3
     (C) x^4
     (D) 1/x^3

<HR>
(2)  Solve for y subject to the given initial condition:
     (A)  y' = y + y e^x,  y=3 when x=0.
     (B)  y' = x/y,        y=3 when x=1.

<HR>
(3)  How long will it take savings in the bank to grow tenfold, assuming an 
     annual relative interest rate of 6% which is 
     (A)  compounded continuously
     (B)  compounded only once a year?

<HR>
(4)  River A flows into Lake Placid at the rate of 10 gallons/second, and River
     B flows into this lake at the rate of 20 gallons/second.  River A contins 
     2 grams of salt per gallon, and River B contains 3.5 grams of salt per 
     gallon.  Lake Placid has 1000 gallons of water, with an initial 
     concentration (at time t=0) of only 1 gram of salt per gallon.
     The salty waters from Rivers A and B mix instantly with the lake water, 
     and the mixture drains out through river C at the rate of 30 gallons per 
     second. 
     (A)  Let Q(t) denote the number of grams of salt in the lake at time t.  
	  Write a differential equation which Q(t) satisfies.
     (B)  Solve to find Q(t).  There should be no unknown constants in your 
	  answer for Q(t).
     (C)  How much salt will be in the lake in the long run (i.e., afer 
	  billions and billions of years)?

<HR>
(5)  Normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius.  A murdered man is found at
     noon (t=0) with body temperature of only 32 degrees, and two hours later, 
     the body is 30 detrees.  The outside temperature aound the body has been a 
     constant 10 detrees.  Assume that the body cools according to Newton's law 
     of cooling.  Find the time that the murder took place by setting up and 
     solving an appropriate differential equation.
