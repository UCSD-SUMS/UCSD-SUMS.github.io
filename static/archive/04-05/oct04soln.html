 Given any positive integer p, there is exactly one interpolytion
 polynomial S(x,p) of degree at most (p+1) such that
 S(n,p) = 1^p + 2^p + ... + n^p for all evaluations at n=0,..,(p+1).
 The coefficients are all rational, because the linear equation system
 that leads to these coefficients only contains rational elements. If we 
 can
 show, that the equality is true for all natural n, then of course S(x,p) 
 is
 the only polynomial that meets this condition (there is only one 
 polynomial
 of degree at most p+k that complies with the equation also for n up to 
 p+k,
 and our S(x,p) will do).
 There can only be one polynomial F of degree at most p with F(n) = (n+1)^p
 for n=0,...p. Therefore, F(x) = (x+1)^p for all x. S(x+1,p) - S(x,p) also
 is a polynomial of degree at most p that meets this condition, so
 S(x+1,p) - S(x) = (x+1)^p for all x. This can be used for the induction:
 If we already know, that 1^p + 2^p + ... + n^p = S(n,p) for an integer n
 (and we do know this for n=0,...,p+1), then:
 S(n+1,p) = S(n,p) + (n+1)^p = 1^p + 2^p + ... + n^p + (n+1)^p.
 So indeed S(n,p) = 1^p + 2^p + ... + n^p for all positive integers n.<BR>

 Let p be a positive integer. As shown above, S(x+1,p) - S(x,p) = (x+1)^p
 for all (rational) x. Especially:
 S(1,p) - S(0,p) = 1^p = S(1,p), so S(0,p) = 0 (0 is a root of S(x,p)).
 0 - S(-1,p) = S(0,p) - S(-1,p) = 0^p = 0, so -1 also is a root of S(x,p).
 For any positive integer n, if we add S(-k,p) - S(-k-1,p) = (-k)^p for all
 k=1,..,n, we get:
 S(-1,p) - S(-n-1,p) = (-1)^p + (-2)^p + ... + (-n)^p = (-1)^p * S(n,p), so
 S(-n-1,p) + (-1)^p * S(n,p) = 0, and therefore for all (rational) x:<BR>
<blockquote>
 (*)  S(-x-1,p) + (-1)^p * S(x,p) = 0
</blockquote>
 If p > 0 is even, then for x = -1/2, this evaluates to:
 S(-(-1/2)-1,p) + (-1)^p * S(-1/2,p) = 0, so S(-1/2,p) + S(-1/2,p) = 0, and
 thus S(-1/2,p) = 0, so -1/2 indeed is a root of S(x,p).
 Now, let p > 1 be odd.
 Then, (*) becomes S(-x-1,p) = S(x,p), that means that S(x,p) is symmetric
 to the axis x = -1/2. Therefore, differentiating by x, S'(-1/2,p) = 0.
 To show that 0 is a double root, we must show that S'(0,p) = 0 (we already
 know that S(0,p)=0). From S(x+1,p) - S(x,p) = (x+1)^p, it follows that
 S'(x+1,p) - S'(x,p) = p*(x+1)^p, and therefore S'(x,p) = p*S(x,p-1) + c
 for some constant c. Since S(-1/2),p-1) = 0 (p-1 is even), we see that
 c also must be 0, so 0 is a double root of S(x,p). Because of the symmetry
 of S(x,p), also -1 must be a double root.<BR>
