<BLOCKQUOTE>During my time at UCSD I worked in an engineering
   position at a company called Linkabit.  They are still in business
   and owned by Titan right across from the Torrey Pines Golf Course.
    My time there was invaluable in preparing me for work after
   graduation.  In fact, I was already an engineer when I graduated
   from UCSD.  In the years since graduation in 1986/87 I have
   started new divisions using Department of Defense (DOD) technology
   transfer concepts, started my own company, retired and re-joined
   the workforce at what is basically a startup company where I am
   involved in all aspects of the business operations.
   
   <P>I began as a lab rat, and still feel comfortable in developing
   SW but I have been lucky enough to have kept my engineering roots
   and moved into the equally exciting aspects on the business side. 
   At this time I am responsible for the development of projects in
   places such as Mexico City, Budapest and London.</P>
   
   <P>I am interested in supporting the concept of providing insight
   into what opportunities the real world provides if a person is
   motivated and willing to think outside the box.   I am proud to
   say that a person who supported me as an office assistant has just
   graduated from UCSD with her own engineering degree based on her
   willingness to take a chance.  It took her over six years but she
   now is doing what I did at Titan, working as an engineer and
   thriving both personally and professionally.</P>
   
   <P>Although my support for the Mathematics Department has been
   limited (or nonexistent) I feel that I may have an interesting
   story to tell and some real-world examples to bring to the table. 
   And, with all the stuff that is going on here at Coded, there are
   opportunities for internships for the right type of person.</P>
