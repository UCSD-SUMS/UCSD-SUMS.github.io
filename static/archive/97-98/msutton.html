   <P><B>Degree: </B> B.A. Applied Mathematics, 1997</P>
   
   <P><B>Job:</B></P>
   
   <P>In September 1997 I started working for Blue Data, Inc. A
   start-up software company located in Sorrento Valley. We are
   developing a software suite of tools that manage company reports,
   extract report data into database tables, and allow end users to
   query this data over the Internet.</P>
   
   <P>As a start-up company we have few employees and my job entails
   more than just programming. I've gone with sales staff for product
   demonstrations to answer technical questions. I've gone to other
   companies to install our software. I also provide technical
   support over the phone and offsite. And I help keep our LAN in
   working order. These extra tasks are not too frequent and they
   provide a variety that I enjoy.</P>
   
   <P>As for programming I enjoy it alot and hope the software I help
   produce will prove useful to many people (and provide a good
   income). Application programming for the Internet is also not a
   bad skill to have, I think.<BR>
   </P>
   
   <P><B>Projects:</B></P>
   
   <P>My first assignment was to write C++ functions that would
   search report text for dates in a specified format (such as
   mm/dd/yyyy). Then store the dates in a structure. The functions
   were used to search report text for dates so they could be placed
   in a table column.</P>
   
   <P>The last finished project was 2D graphics in the GIF file
   format. The graphics are dynamically generated bar, pie, and
   histogram charts based on table data. This project required that I
   learn CGI programming, ODBC, some SQL, and the GIF file format (in
   short, things I didn't learn in math classes).</P>
   
   <P>Currently I'm working with JavaScript and studying Java.<BR>
   </P>
   
   <P><B>Computer courses taken at UCSD:</B></P>
   
   <P>Introductory programming as required of applied math majors;
   two C programming courses taken through UCSD Extention; computer
   science courses as required for a minor; and programming done in
   numerical analysis,statstics, modern algebra and other math
   courses.<BR>
   <BR>
   </P>
   
   <P>Even after I graduated as an applied math major I was not fixed
   on programming as a career. I also was considering becoming an
   actuary since I liked statistics and enjoyed the actuarial science
   courses at UCSD. I think a mathematics degree gives a foot in the
   door for a variety of career paths.<BR>
   </P>
