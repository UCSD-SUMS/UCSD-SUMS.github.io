Internships</H1>

<P>An internship is usually an unpaid, short-term, entry-level job,
in which an individual gains practical skills and personal and
professional experience. Interns are often able to experience a
variety of aspects of the job experience, which helps when
determining a career path. In today's competitive job market
internships are an increasingly important way for young people to get
into their first job and career.</P>

<P>Internships can last from a month to two years and can be
part-time or full-time, paid or unpaid. Many companies offer fall,
spring and summer internships, and some colleges and universities
give academic credit for both part- and full-time positions. UCSD
internships are based on a 10 week minimum commitment and are
performed without academic credit unless special arrangements are
made. It is preferable if they are arranged five weeks before the
start date.</P>

Department Internship Program</B></H2>

<P>The UCSD Department of Mathematics, together with our industrial
partners offers an Internship Program designed to supplement the
regular academic curriculum with hands on experience. The Internship
Program acts as a bridge between the academic community and the
surrounding world of applied technology and commerce.</P>

<P>The Program provides value to both students and industry, and it
is a mutually beneficial way to develop a networking relationship
between students and industry.</P>

<P>There are several benefits for students who participate in this
program. Students gain valuable insight into the relationship between
theory and practice, and, hence a better understanding of the
relevance of coursework in their major. The program can also work to
stimulate students' interest in certain fields, and thereby allow
them to gain insight into their future and make more confident and
informed choices about their careers. The day-to-day working
experience prepares students to meet the demands of the commercial
world, which in turn gives them a competitive edge in the
marketplace.</P>

<P>Students who are interested in participating in this program may
receive further information by contacting the Math Department
Advising Office, located in Applied Physics and Math room 2313A
(phone: 534-6009), or by sending electronic mail to the <A HREF="mailto:mathadvisor@ucsd.edu">Math
Advising Office. </A></P>

<H2><CENTER>Learn practical skills</CENTER></H2>

<P>Internships provide the opportunity to learn practical skills,
from understanding computer software programs to analyzing profit and
loss statements. It is a chance to examine a work culture and the
different styles that come along with it -- how to work in a team or
alone, how to dress, or how to work under deadline pressure.</P>

<H3>Finding opportunities</H3>

<P>Listings of many available internships are available in the
reference section of most school and public libraries. You can also
call companies directly and inquire about internship programs.</P>

<P>Be sure to make calls well in advance as deadlines can be early.
Getting a head start will not only give you enough time to get
organized, but it could also give you a leg up when trying to secure
a competitive internship.

<H2><CENTER>A Key to a Job</CENTER></H2>

<P>A recent study discovered that a quarter of the new hires by
prestigious Fortune 500 companies had participated in an internship
program while a student. The reward for caring enough about their
future careers to spend the time and effort required by an internship
was a full-time job after graduation.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF3300"><B>Here are some questions and answers
designed to help you make the most of an internship
opportunity.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">What is an internship and how does it differ
from a job? </FONT></P>

<P>An internship is a short-term work experience with an employer in
a career field of interest to you. It emphasizes learning on the job
rather than earning. It provides a chance to observe the work, to
gain on-the-job experience and to learn how you like the field. It
may take place during a summer vacation, a term off from school, or
part-time during the school year.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">Why is an internship important? </FONT></P>

<P>Related experience is the number one factor employers use when
hiring employees. Internships can offer you actual hands-on
experience in a field of interest. Internships can also help you test
your skills and interests in that field. It will give you practice in
some valuable job hunting skills, such as creating a resume and
interviewing. Internships can also provide you with useful contacts
and possibly a reference for future employment.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">How can you learn of internships?
</FONT></P>

<P>The Career Development Center library has a number of national
directories which cite programs such as Internships 1995, Student's
Guide to Mass Media Internships, America's Top 100 Internships,
Directory of Internships in Youth Development, and more. The Career
Development Center has listings of internships in their library.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">Can I create my own internship? </FONT></P>

<P>Definitely, and these are often the most useful. Any organization
in a field of interest to you is a candidate. Explore the
organization, see where you might fit in best, and propose a plan to
the employer. This is an area where alumni could be helpful. In
approaching alumni, ask for advice on how to proceed.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">Are some internships paid? </FONT></P>

<P>Yes, compensation for paid internships is at least minimum wage,
but the key should be the value of the work experience provided.
Given a choice between one which pays (with little work experience of
value) and one which does not pay (and offers good, relevant
experience), consider taking the unpaid internship.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF3300">Why do employers like internships?
</FONT></P>

<P>They like the enthusiasm and dedication of the interns.
Furthermore, for little cost, they get to preview prospective
candidates for employment, and if they really like you they may offer
you a job after graduation.</P>
