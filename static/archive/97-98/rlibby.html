<BLOCKQUOTE>Richard A. Libby<FONT SIZE="+1"><B> </B></FONT>(Revelle,
   1980, B.A., Mathematics) continued work in pure mathematics,
   obtaining an M.A. from UCSD in 1982 and a Ph.D. from UC Santa Cruz
   in 1990. He chose math as a major after having enjoyed the
   intellectual appeal of analytical methods behind the calculus
   learned in high school. Further research led to a doctoral
   dissertation in Functional Analysis. Finding more opportunities in
   applications than in academic research, Richard entered the
   finance profession and now works in Risk Management for Bank of
   America, designing systems to support the Bank's efforts to
   measure market and credit exposure for its global trading
   activities. In his current position as Vice President and Senior
   Manager of Technical Finance, Richard manages three quantitative
   analysts who measure market driven credit exposures and develop
   pricing methods for new derivatives transactions. He recently
   completed a project as principal architect of the bank's global
   market risk system.
   
   <P>In spite of his non-academic career path, Richard continues to
   follow the latest advances in mathematics, by maintaining
   membership in the A.M.S. and S.I.A.M., reading up on a recent
   article on his favorite living mathematician, Michael Freedman,
   who has augmented his position with UCSD faculty by joining the
   research team at Microsoft, where he carries out research on the
   P=NP problem. Richard attended Prof. Freedman's seminars just
   after the announcement of the solution of the Poincare conjecture
   in four dimensions, and remembers the analysis of "hairy red blood
   cells" and "six-fold group death."</P>
   
   <P>If the study of mathematics is irresistible, then by all means
   study mathematics. The time spent in the university is a
   substantial fraction of the time allotted on earth and should be
   considered, in part, an ends in itself. Mathematics, even pure
   mathematics, is not a field of study restricted to future
   university professors.</P>
