The Current Problem: Cherry Slurpees</FONT></P>

<P>A customer at a 7-11 store selected four items to buy, and was
told that the total cost of the four items (without tax) was $7.11.
He was curious that the cost was the same as the store name, so he
inquired as to how the figure was derived. The clerk said that he had
simply multiplied the prices of the four individual items. The
customer protested that the four prices should have been ADDED, not
MULTIPLIED. The clerk said that that was okay with him, but, the
result was still the same: exactly $7.11.</P>

<P>What were the prices of the four items?</P>
