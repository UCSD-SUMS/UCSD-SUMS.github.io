<P><B>Major/Degree:</B> Ph.D, Mathematics, 1985</P>

<P><B>Why did you choose math as a major?</B> I enjoyed working on
math problems, not so much games and puzzles with (what I perceived
as) no applications but on problems that might relate to science and
technology.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Favorite Math Professor: </B>Stephan Warschowski. This is a
hard question because there are so many excellent prof's at UCSD, but
Warschowski was so meticulous and clear in lectures that he
contributed a lot to my professional growth as a young grad student
and left a lasting impression on me.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Favorite Mathematician: </B>Lars Hormander. This is also a hard
question because there are so many really significant names in any
branch of mathematics (PDE in this case) and anyone's learning
necessarily owes to quite a few of them. But I fell in love with PDE
after looking at Hormander's '63 book as a grad student, well before
I could really understand it; he is still the single most inspiring
author for me.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Employer Name:</B> Space and Naval Warfare (SPAWAR) Systems
Center (SSC)<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Employer Description:</B> SSC is a Navy lab that develops
sonar, radar, communications, and command and control systems for the
Navy.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Job Title:</B> Scientist / Mathematician<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Job Description:</B> Provide mathematical support for
engineering projects and engineers at SSC.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Skills used</B><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>:</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Mathematical:</B> Calculus and Linear Algebra, 'Pure'
   Analysis (real, complex, manifolds, functional), 'Applied'
   Analysis (differential and integral equations - we use the
   Helmholtz equation for wave propagation a lot - calculus of
   variations, integral transforms and series expansions, special
   functions, etc), Probability (lots of stochastic processes and
   harmonic analysis of time series, occasionally Ito's ODEs and
   integrals, stochastic filtering and control), Statistics (LOTS OF
   THIS, regression, analysis of variance, multivariate analysis,
   discrimination and classification, reliability tests, maximum
   likelihood estimation, time series analysis), Numerical Methods
   (LOTS OF THIS, linear algebra, ODEs and PDEs, optimization),
   Engineering and Physics (signal processing, acoustics,
   electromagnetic wave propagation, continuum mechanics).
   
   <P><B>Computer:</B> Non-technical Applications Software (email,
   word processing, spread sheets, graphics and presentation vugraphs
   -MS Office and Eudora seem to be our standards here), Technical
   Applications Software (mathematical packages -Matlab is almost
   ubiquitous here-, statistics packages -I like S+), Programming
   Languages (C -I can't tolerate it but it's what most people use-,
   Fortran is still in use).</P>
   
   <P><B>Interpersonal:</B> This is important, especially if you want
   to move up in management. Many of our technical people have rather
   poor interpersonal skills in the sense of being graceful, and if
   you want to stay in technical work that's not much of a
   disadvantage. But truthfulness is important for a good technical
   person; managers will respect a technical person who tells them
   the truth about a project (eg, that it won't work), and not just
   what someone higher up wants to hear (eg, that it will work). It
   is also important for technical people to be able to present
   results, both formally and informally, clearly and as simply as
   possible; some technical people are very smart but they give
   complicated answers to simple questions, and their colleagues are
   soon worn out by the mental load of trying to figure out what they
   just said.<BR>
   </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>How did you come to choose a career in this field? </B>In
school I developed a love for mathematical analysis; I wanted a job
that gave me a chance to use it. I also felt that school (at least
the courses I took) left me pretty ignorant of applications of
mathematics, so I talked to someone working as an applied
mathematician at the Navy lab and found out that they used quite a
bit of mathematics in their work, far more than just undergraduate or
even beginning graduate level stuff. I felt that a few years in a job
like that would serve me as a 'post doc' in applied math and enhance
both my math skills and my knowledge of applications.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>What you like most about your job? </B>The chance to use
mathematics, some of it fairly advanced, to help people (engineers in
my case) solve applied quantitative problems. I should also say that
much of this 'problem solving' really amounts to helping them
understand their problems using (mathematical) tools that are more
general than what they've seen in their training.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>What you like least about your job?</B> I sometimes miss
teaching math courses. If I were in academics I would perhaps miss
being involved with significant applications; being in applications I
miss the chance to develop a set of lecture notes on the basics of a
topic and explain it to students.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Advice for undergrads: </B> Give attention to your 'core'
courses; learn to compute things, but also learn to do proofs because
clear, logical thinking is one of the most important skills you can
bring to your job.<BR>
