<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Degree:</B> Ph.D. Mathematical Statistics, 1981
   
   <P><B>Why did you choose math as a major?</B> Math is always the
   center of science. In addition, statistics is closer to daily life
   than some of the pure math subjects.</P>
   
   <P><B>Job Title:</B> Director</P>
   
   <P><B>Job Description: </B>I have been through 3 jobs: AT&amp;T
   Bell Labs, a pharmaceutical company, and an investment company. By
   far, Bell Labs has the highest appreciation of the technical
   skills. The pharmaceutical company needed lots of data processing
   and analytical skills in the biostatistics area. The investment
   company needed quick thinking rather than actual deep knowledge.
   (Most of the people do not have high degree in this field.) The
   most important thing for a statistician is to not to be afraid of
   numbers, a lot of numbers, as data processing is major part of the
   daily life. If you do not like to get your hands dirty, I suggest
   you either go into teaching or into some research institutes. From
   my experience, job satisfaction is far more important than money.
   A good boss is far more important than a good company. I changed
   my jobs primarily because of the boss not the company. Sometimes,
   when your boss asks you to do some work which you really do not
   like or conflicts with your personal goals, it is the time to
   change jobs. Remember, if you can keep updating yourself (and not
   make your life too easy), you can always find opportunities out
   there.</P>
