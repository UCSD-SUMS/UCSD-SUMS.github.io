<P><FONT SIZE="+2">The Three Sons Problem</FONT></P>

<P>Two men are talking. One says to the other, "I have three sons
whose ages I want you to figure out from the following clues. Stop me
when you know their ages.</P>

<P>"1. The sum of their ages is thirteen.<BR>
"2. The product of their ages is the same as your age.<BR>
"3. My oldest son weighs sixty-one pounds."</P>

<P>"Stop," says the second man. "I know their ages."</P>

<P>What are their ages?<BR>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This problem was solved by <B>Daniel Giaimo</B>.</P>

<FONT SIZE="+3"><B>The Solution:</B></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The first clue implies that the three ages add to 13. The only
triplets of integers that add to 13 are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(1,1,11), (1,2,10), (1,3,9), (1,4,8), (1,5,7), (1,6,6),
   (2,2,9), (2,3,8), (2,4,7), (2,5,6), (3,3,7), (3,4,6), (3,5,5),
   (4,4,5)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Because the second man didn't get the answer after the second
clue, at least 2 of these triplets must have the same product. The
only two that have the same product are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(1,6,6), (2,2,9)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Because the third clue mentions an oldest child, the answer must
be*:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(2,2,9)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>--Daniel Giaimo</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>* Daniel also notes that: &nbsp;"Actually, the answer could still
be 1,6,6 since the two six-year olds were most likely not born at the
same instant." This is technically true, but it's unlikely that a
father would refer to one twin as his "oldest child".</P>
