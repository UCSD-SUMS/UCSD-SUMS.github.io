<P><FONT SIZE="+3">The Problem:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Shooting Hoops</FONT></P>

<P>Joe, Ben, and Maggie have a free throw contest. Whoever makes the
first free throw is the winner. Being the youngest, Joe, who only
makes 40% of his baskets, gets the first shot. Ben, who makes 60% of
his baskets, then shoots, followed by Maggie, who makes 70% of her
baskets. If all three players miss, Joe shoots again and they
continue until someone wins.</P>

<P>What is the probability that Joe wins the game?</P>

<P>What is the probability that Ben wins the game?</P>

<P>What is the probability that Maggie wins the game?</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This problem was solved by <B>Barry Smith</B>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+3">The Solution:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The sample space for the experiment described can be represented
as</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>J<BR>
   J B<BR>
   J B M<BR>
   J B M J<BR>
   J B M J B<BR>
   J B M J B M<BR>
   J B M J B M J<BR>
   ...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where J stands for Joe, B stands for Ben, and M stands for Maggie,
and each outcome listed shows the succession of free-throws shot
terminating in the person who finally makes the shot.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now the series of outcomes where Joe wins is</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>J<BR>
   J B M J<BR>
   J B M J B M J<BR>
   ...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The probability Joe makes the initial shot is given as 0.4<BR>
The probability that Joe misses a shot is 1-0.4 = 0.6,<BR>
The probability that Ben misses a shot is 1-0.6 = 0.4,<BR>
and the probability that Maggie misses a shot is 1-0.7 = 0.3</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Thus, the first outcome in this series has a probability of </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>0.4</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The second outcome has a probability of </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(0.6)(0.4)(0.3)*0.4 = 0.072 * 0.4</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The third outcome has a probability of</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(0.6)(0.4)(0.3)(0.6)(0.4)(0.3)*0.4 = (0.072)^2 * 0.4</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Similarly, the kth outcome consists of k-1 appearances of J B M
where all three miss, followed by J making the basket, so the
probability for the kth outcome is</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>((0.6)(0.4)(0.3))^(k-1) * 0.4 = (0.072)^(k-1) * 0.4</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Thus, the sums of the probabilities of every outcome where Joe
wins is </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(0.4) + (0.4)(0.072) + (0.4)(0.072)^2 + ... +
   (0.4)(0.072)^(k-1) + ...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This is a geometric series where the factor is 0.072 &lt; 1, so
the sum is</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> (0.4)/(1 - 0.072)
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE>= (0.4)/(0.928)
      
      <P>= 25/58</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The sequence of outcomes where Ben wins is</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>J B<BR>
   J B M J B<BR>
   J B M J B M J B<BR>
   ...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The kth outcome this time has a probability of </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(0.072)^(k-1) * (0.6)(0.6) </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>by the same reasoning as above, where the 0.6 * 0.6 is the
combination of Joe missing his shot and Ben making his shot in the
last round. Thus, the sum of the probabilities for outcomes where Ben
wins is again a geometric series:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(0.6)(0.6) + (0.6)(0.6)(0.072) + (0.6)(0.6)(0.072)^2 +
   ... + (0.6)(0.6)(0.072)^(k-1) + ...
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE>= (0.6)(0.6)/(1 - 0.072)
      
      <P>= (0.36)/(0.928)</P>
      
      <P>= 90/232</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Finally the sequence of outcomes where Maggie wins is</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>J B M<BR>
   J B M J B M<BR>
   J B M J B M J B M<BR>
   ...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The kth outcome this time has a probability of </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(0.072)^(k-1) * (0.6)(0.4)(0.7)
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE>= (0.072)^(k-1) * (0.168)</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>where the (0.6)(0.4)(0.7) comes from the final round where Joe and
Ben miss their shots, and Maggie makes hers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The sum of the probabilities for outcomes where Maggie wins is
again a geometric series</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(0.168) + (0.168)(0.072) + (0.168)(0.072)^2 + ... +
   (0.168) (0.072)^(k-1) + ...
   
   <BLOCKQUOTE>= (0.168)/(1 - 0.072)
      
      <P>= (0.168)/(0.928)</P>
      
      <P>= 21/116</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In summary, the probability that Joe wins the game is 25/58
<FONT COLOR="#990000">(~ 43%)</FONT></P>

<P>	    the probability that Ben wins the game is 90/232
<FONT COLOR="#990000">(~ 39%)</FONT></P>

<P>     and the probability that Maggie wins the game is 21/116
<FONT COLOR="#990000">(~ 18%)</FONT></P>
