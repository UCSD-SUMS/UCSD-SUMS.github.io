<P><B>Degree:</B> B.A. Applied Mathematics, Minor in Economics,
1989</P>

<P><B>Employer Name:</B> Sybase, Inc.<BR>
<B>Employer Description:</B> Database Software<BR>
<B>Job Title:</B> Compensation Analyst</P>

<P><B>Job Description:</B> I work within the Sales Operation
department of Sybase. My job entails tracking revenue accruals and
paying commissions to sales reps. Additionally, I am responsible for
reporting revenue by district and sales rep performance on a monthly,
quarterly, and annual basis.</P>

<P><B>Describe a typical day at work:</B> It varies day to day. I
mainly deal with issues involving deals booked by the reps. I work
with the company's computer systems to find the deals and report back
to the rep on its location. Occassionally, I am involved in special
projects creating databases to store and report information, and
program spreadsheets to automate the departments monthly
processes.</P>

<P><B>Skills used:</B> Lots of work with spreadsheets-Microsoft
Excel. Reports are generated through Microsoft Access. You must be
able to accurately communicate ideas and concepts to the sales
representatives and managers.</P>

<P><B>How did you come to choose this job/a career in this field:</B>
Found the job through friends - I wanted to use my math background in
a business setting. I found the programming environment was too
boring for me. I wanted a job that interacted with people on a daily
basis.</P>

<P><B>What you like most about your job:</B> Working with individuals
at all levels of the company -- a vice president one day, maybe a
sales rep in Chicago the next.</P>

<P><B>What you like least about your job:</B> During the quarter end,
the hours are very long (12 midnight)</P>

<P><B>Why did you choose math as a major? </B>I enjoy solving
mathematical problems. Math provides a solid background for entering
the business world.</P>

<P><B>Favorite Mathematician:</B> Albert Einstein and/or Sir Isaac
Newton (tie)</P>

<P><B>Advice/words of wisdom for undergrads:</B> Mathematical
Programming background is an excellent starting point/degree for
entering the high tech industry. The saying "Its not what you know,
but who you know" applies to finding a job. Sending resumes to
companies will get you nowhere. You need to know someone within the
company of interest that can speak on your behalf. Also, getting good
grades is important but you need to be a well rounded individual with
outside interests like sports or a social club. Employers want a
person, not a book-worm. Communication skills are very important in
the business world.</P>
