<P class="mycopy"><B>Combinatorial Games</B>
<BR>Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT) is one of the newest fields in Mathematics. It is the study of analyzing a special classification of games which can be broken down into smaller sub-games (almost in a recursive manner) down to the point where a winner can be determined. There are birthdays and outcome classes, theorems and principles, rules and regulations, symbols and logic, proofs and calculations. CGT features not only numbers but also features non-number games such as Star, Double-Down, Tiny-Two, and SesquiUp.
</P>
<P class="mycopy">CGT has recently become a thriving interest at UC San Diego's Mathematics Department as well as an excellent platform of outreach for the Math Club.  In an effort to reach the rest of the campus, the Math Club holds a Combinatorial Games Tournament in the Spring during Math Awareness Month (April) open to all students.
<BR><BR>If you are the least bit interested, we encourage you to look into the following course: <A HREF="../external.html?link=http://www.calculusfairy.com/CGT" TARGET="_blank"><B>MATH 168A:</B> Topics in Computer Science—Combinatorial Game Theory</A>.

</P>
<P class="mycopy">Throughout the year, we will post problems to the Math Club website. Every week there will be a new problem posted. If a UCSD undergraduate student solves the current problem, his or her name and solution to the problem will be posted in the archives. If the previous week's problem is not solved, it will be moved to the archives. It will remain open until a person emails a correct solution to the Math Club.
</P>
<P class="mycopy">Some of the problems will be easy, some of them will be hard, but we won't tell you which are easy and which are hard. You'll just have to try them and see!
