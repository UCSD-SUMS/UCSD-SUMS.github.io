# Our Purpose
We, the Society for Undergraduate Mathematics Students, would like to serve as a gathering place, as well as an academic and career resource, where all students interested in mathematics can further their involvement in the subject, meet other people with similar interests, and discover some of the opportunities mathematics has to offer.

# What We Do
The Society for Undergraduate Mathematics Students hosts various seminars dealing with graduate education, careers, and topics in mathematics to provide resources for our members. We also hold social events in order for mathematically-inclined people to meet and exchange ideas.
